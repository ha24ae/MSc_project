# MSc Project: ETL and Data Pipelines

This project explores the design, implementation, and optimization of **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** processes and **data pipelines** for managing large-scale data workflows.

## Objectives

- Investigate common ETL patterns and tools
- Build a pipelines for data ingestion, transformation, and loading
- Evaluate performance, scalability, and reliability of pipeline architectures

## Technologies

- Python (e.g., pandas, Airflow)
- SQL / PostgreSQL
- Apache Airflow 
- Cloud storage or databases - AWS S3

## Repository Structure

This repository will be actively updated throughout the dissertation timeline (2025). The final version will include the complete pipeline implementation, evaluation results, and accompanying dissertation report.
